First pass on the UI I forgot UISearchBar was a thing... Oops

This is my first time working with reactive code.
I had seen some minor amount of RXJava in previous development, but hadn't had a chance to use it myself.
Using RxSwift/RxCocoa made this an interesting experience and also allowed me to keep my code concise.
I definitely want to spend more time with reactive code after using it here.

I have not yet had time to write tests, will get back to that as time allows.
